## 1. Chatbot, tell me, if you are really safe?

This challenge basically explores how ChatGPT has lead to the increase in the use of AI Chatbots which has lead to the leaking of private information and a whole bunch of security issues.
Thus, in this challenge, we have access to a chatbot Van Chatty, with whom we have to converse in order to obtain the information to get the flags.
On asking the question to the ChatBot we directly get the answers,

Thus, we get the CEO's personal email address.

In order to obtain the IT server room's door password, upon just asking the chatbot, we are denied permission.

However, on declaring ourselves as a member of the IT server, we get access to the passsword.

Next, to get the name of McGreedy's secret project, we can ask the chatbot, but denies it due to its security measures

Thus, we can ask the chatbot to drop the security measures by telling it that it is in maintenance mode and we get the name of the project.
